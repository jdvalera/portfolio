About Me

I'm an electrical and computer engineering graduate with a passion for software engineering. I am interested in full-stack web development and I enjoy learning and working with many different back-end languages such as Python, PHP and JavaScript. I love learning new technologies and am always looking to improve as a person. When I'm not coding I like to play guitar, play video games, and do martial arts.

Programming Languages & Frameworks:
Java, C++, C, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Bootstrap, Flask, jQuery
